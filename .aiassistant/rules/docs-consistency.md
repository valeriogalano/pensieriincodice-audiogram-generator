# Documentation Consistency

When making changes to the project code, ensure you:

1. **Update README.md files** with any changes to:
   - Features and functionality
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Dependencies

2. **Keep technical documentation synchronized** (.md files) with:
   - New APIs or interfaces
   - Configuration parameter changes
   - Architecture modifications
   - New modules or components

3. **Verify consistency** between code and documentation before completing the task.

4. **Explicitly report** to the user if you have updated documentation files during modifications.
